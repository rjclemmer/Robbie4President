  ## Description
  This is a parody 2024 presidential candidate website for Robbie Evans, our classes TA. We love Robbie, so we built a React application that integrates OpenAI’s API. Users are able to chat with “AI Robbie,” who has been prompted to share their plans and presidential platform. Our group integrated Twitter into this application and utilized Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness. MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, GraphQL, and Apollo were utilized to structure our backend of this application. When user’s sign up or login, a JWT is stored to check for authentication. GraphQL serves as an interface between the client and server, enabling the client to request specific data. The server responds with only the requested data, which makes for efficient communication. We hope you enjoy exploring our React app! Vote for Robbie!
