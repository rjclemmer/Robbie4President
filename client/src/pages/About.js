            Robbie is not your average presidential candidate. He began his
            career as a coding TA, teaching students the valuable skills needed
            to thrive in the 21st century. An avid foosball player, he honed his
            strategic thinking and teamwork abilities both in the classroom and
            on the playing field. Most importantly, he is a proud golden
            retriever enthusiast, with a heart full of love and compassion for
            his furry friends and the American people.

            As a teenager, Robbie discovered a passion for foosball, and his
            ability to connect with others and share the lessons he learned from
            Buddy helped him lead his high school foosball team to victory.
            Against all odds, Robbie and his team made it to the national
            championship, where they united as one unstoppable force. The team's
            incredible triumph was a testament to Robbie's unwavering
            dedication, his ability to inspire others, and the enduring impact
            of the invaluable life lessons he learned from his beloved golden
            retriever, Buddy.
